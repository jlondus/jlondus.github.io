			<h3>Meeting Library</h3>

			<p>The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Meeting Library provides access to top scientific research on state-of-the-art treatment modalities, new therapies and ongoing controversies in the field of oncology. I helped the organization to design an improved user experience that streamlines access to this cutting-edge information in support of their vision of a world where cancer is prevented or cured, and every survivor is healthy.</p>

			<h3>Oncology Practice Central</h3>
			<p>Website</p>
			<img src="images/OPC.png" alt="Oncology Practice homepage">
			<p>Busy oncology practice professionals have no centralized, go-to resource to help them quickly and easily navigate complex regulations and administrative challenges. I worked with ASCO to address this problem by creating a new, reliable site that consolidates the information and tools needed to provide high-quality patient care and ensure continued payments from government and private insurers.</p>

		<h2>About</h2>
		<p>Based in Washington, D.C., I research user needs and business goals and develop strategies to meet them. I’m passionate about designing clear, usable interfaces.</p>
		<p>I hold a Master’s in Library and Information Science, and in other lives I’ve worked as a museum professional, a librarian and an archivist. But one thing I’ve always been driven by is creating seamless, enjoyable experiences that delivers the right information to the right people, at the right time.</p>
